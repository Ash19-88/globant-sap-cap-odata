# OData Exercises

This repository contains exercises related to OData services, developed as part of the SAP CAP Bootcamp at Globant. The exercises are based on the Northwind OData service and demonstrate queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

## Overview

The goal of these exercises is to familiarize with OData queries by solving specific scenarios.  
The Northwind OData service is used as the data source:

2. **Retrieve employees who report to the manager with ID "2".**
3. **Retrieve products that are in stock (inventory).**
4. **Retrieve only the names and codes of products that are NOT in stock.**
5. **Retrieve the 5 most expensive products.**
6. **Find orders that were shipped to "Germany".**
